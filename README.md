# Nginx Docker Setup

## Overview
This project guides you through the process of setting up and configuring Nginx in Docker, building your own web server using FastCGI, and utilizing Docker Compose for multi-container deployment. The project focuses on practical tasks like configuring Nginx, building Docker images, and ensuring security compliance.

## Project Structure
1. **Part 1: Nginx Docker Image**  
   Goal: Work with the official Nginx Docker imageâ€”pull it, run it, and verify its status.

2. **Part 2: Container Operations**  
   Goal: Manage Nginx container configuration, status page, and lifecycle (export, import, run).

3. **Part 3: FastCGI Mini Server**  
   Goal: Create a simple web server using C and FastCGI, and configure Nginx to proxy requests to it.

4. **Part 4: Custom Docker Image**  
   Goal: Build a Docker image for your FastCGI server, integrate it with Nginx, and optimize Dockerfile usage.

5. **Part 5: Dockle Security Check**  
   Goal: Ensure the security of the custom Docker image using Dockle and resolve any security warnings.

6. **Part 6: Docker Compose**  
   Goal: Deploy the project using Docker Compose to manage multiple containers and network configurations.
